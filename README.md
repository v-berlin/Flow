     ```json
     "2024-01-15": {
       "percent": 105.5,
       "minutes": 127,
       "sick": false
     }
     ```
   - Maintains only last 365 days (removes oldest if exceeding)
   - Saves updated JSON back to `flow_history_data`

2. **Streak Logic (conditional):**
   
   **Case A: Sick Mode Enabled**
   - Preserves current streak (no change to `flow_streak_counter`)
   - Sends notification: "🏥 Krankheitstag - Streak bleibt bei [X] Tagen"
   
   **Case B: Goal Reached**
   - Increments `flow_streak_counter` by 1
   - Sends notification: "🔥 Streak! [X] Tage in Folge!"
   
   **Case C: Goal Not Reached (Default)**
   - Resets `flow_streak_counter` to 0

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Home Assistant** running in Docker (tested with 2024.1.0+)
- Access to Home Assistant Web UI
- Access to configuration files via:
  - File Editor (if available as add-on in your setup)
  - Direct volume access (via Docker volume mount)
  - SSH/SFTP access to configuration directory

> **Note for Docker Users:** This guide assumes you have access to your Home Assistant configuration directory. This is typically mapped as a Docker volume (e.g., `/path/on/host:/config`).

---

## 🚀 Setup Guide (Docker Focused)

### Step 1: Access Configuration Files

You need to access your Home Assistant configuration directory. Choose one of these methods:

**Option A: File Editor Add-on (if available)**
1. Install File Editor from the Home Assistant Add-on Store (if not already installed)
2. Navigate to Settings → Add-ons → File Editor
3. Open File Editor

**Option B: Direct File Access**
1. Access your Docker host machine
2. Navigate to your Home Assistant config directory (typically where you mounted the `/config` volume)
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/homeassistant/config
   ```

### Step 2: Copy Configuration Files

Copy the three YAML files from this repository to your Home Assistant configuration directory:

1. **flow.yaml** - Main configuration with all entities and sensors
2. **automations.yaml** - Automations for Flow (append to existing file)
3. **scripts.yaml** - Helper scripts for Flow (append to existing file)

#### Important Notes:

- **If you already have automations.yaml and scripts.yaml:**
  - Open the Flow versions from this repository
  - Copy the content and **append** it to your existing files
  - Do NOT replace your existing files completely

- **For flow.yaml:**
  - Create a new file named `flow.yaml` in your config directory
  - Copy the entire content from the repository

### Step 3: Enable Packages Configuration

You need to tell Home Assistant to load the `flow.yaml` file as a package.

1. Open your `configuration.yaml` file
2. Add or modify the following section:

```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include flow.yaml
```

**If you already have a packages section:**
```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages:
    flow: !include flow.yaml
    # your other packages...
```

**Alternative: Using a packages directory (recommended for multiple packages):**
```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages/
```
Then create a `packages/` directory and place `flow.yaml` inside it.

### Step 4: Restart Home Assistant

After copying the files and updating configuration.yaml:

1. Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Restart**
2. Click **Restart Home Assistant**
3. Wait for the restart to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Step 5: Verify Installation

After restart, verify that Flow entities were created:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities**
2. Search for "flow" - you should see:
   - `input_number.flow_daily_goal`
   - `input_number.flow_time_tracked_today`
   - `input_number.flow_streak_counter`
   - `input_boolean.flow_timer_active`
   - `input_boolean.flow_sick_mode`
   - `input_boolean.flow_cat_work`
   - `input_boolean.flow_cat_privat`
   - `input_boolean.flow_cat_coding`
   - `input_boolean.flow_cat_design`
   - `input_boolean.flow_cat_engineering`
   - `input_datetime.flow_timer_start`
   - `input_datetime.flow_last_reset`
   - `input_text.flow_active_category`
   - `input_text.flow_history_data`
   - `sensor.flow_goal_progress`
   - `sensor.flow_status`
   - `sensor.flow_active_work`
   - `sensor.flow_timer_elapsed`
   - `sensor.flow_time_to_goal`

3. Check automations:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes**
   - You should see 4 new automations starting with "Flow -"

4. Check scripts:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes** → **Scripts** tab
   - You should see scripts starting with "flow_"

### Step 6: Set Initial Values (via Web UI)

Now configure Flow entirely through the Web UI - no YAML editing needed!

1. **Set Your Daily Goal:**
   - Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities**
   - Search for `input_number.flow_daily_goal`
   - Click on it and set your desired daily goal in minutes (e.g., 120 for 2 hours)

2. **Initialize Other Values (Optional):**
   - All other entities are automatically initialized with sensible defaults
   - You can adjust them later as needed

### 🎯 Dashboard Customization Tips

**Color Schemes:**
- Change `color:` values: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `orange`, `purple`, `pink`, `amber`, `cyan`, `teal`, `indigo`, `deep-purple`, `light-blue`, `grey`, `blue-grey`, `brown`

**Layout Adjustments:**
- `vertical: true/false` - Changes tile orientation
- `hide_state: true/false` - Shows/hides entity state text
- Remove cards you don't need
- Reorder cards by cutting and pasting YAML blocks

**Icons:**
- Find more icons at: https://materialdesignicons.com/
- Change `icon:` to any `mdi:icon-name`

**Interactive Features:**
- Add `tap_action: action: more-info` to see entity details
- Add `tap_action: action: toggle` for quick on/off switches
- Add `confirmation: text: "Are you sure?"` to buttons for safety

**Additional Visualizations:**
You can add these card types for more insights:
- `type: gauge` - Circular gauge for progress
- `type: statistic` - Large number display
- `type: bar-gauge` - Progress bar
- `type: graph` - Line graph over time

## 💡 Usage

### Starting a Work Session

1. **Select a Category** (optional but recommended):
   - Tap one of the category buttons (Work, Privat, Coding, Design, Engineering)
   - Only one category can be active at a time

2. **Start the Timer**:
   - Toggle the Timer switch to ON
   - You'll receive a notification confirming the start

3. **Work on Your Task**:
   - The timer tracks your time automatically
   - You can see elapsed time in real-time

4. **Stop the Timer**:
   - Toggle the Timer switch to OFF
   - Time is automatically added to your daily total
   - You'll receive a notification with session details

### Daily Workflow

1. **Morning**: Check your daily goal and adjust if needed
2. **During the Day**: Track work sessions with the timer
3. **Evening**: Check your progress towards the daily goal
4. **Midnight**: Automatic reset occurs
   - If goal reached: Streak increments
   - If sick mode: Streak preserved
   - Otherwise: Streak resets to 0

### Using Sick Mode

When you're sick or unable to work:

1. Enable **Sick Mode** toggle before midnight
2. Your streak will be preserved during the daily reset
3. Sick mode automatically turns off after midnight

### Adjusting Daily Goal (via Web UI)

**Method 1: Direct Edit**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Entities**
2. Search for `input_number.flow_daily_goal`
3. Click on it and change the value

**Method 2: Using Scripts**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes** → **Scripts**
2. Run `flow_increase_goal` or `flow_decrease_goal` (each changes by 5 minutes)

**Method 3: From Dashboard**
1. Add a Number card to your dashboard for `input_number.flow_daily_goal`
2. Adjust directly from the dashboard

## 🎓 Advanced Usage Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Session Workday

**Scenario:** You work in multiple sessions throughout the day.

**Workflow:**
```
09:00 - Select "Work" category → Start Timer
10:30 - Stop Timer (90 minutes tracked)
        ✓ Progress: 75% (90/120 minutes)

11:00 - Select "Coding" category → Start Timer
12:00 - Stop Timer (60 minutes tracked)
        ✓ Progress: 125% (150/120 minutes)
        ✓ Goal Reached Notification appears!
        ✓ Streak will increment at midnight
```

**Result:** Exceeded daily goal, tracked across two different categories.

---

### Example 2: Sick Day Management

**Scenario:** You're sick after completing a 14-day streak.

**Workflow:**
```
Morning - Feeling unwell, can't work
        - Enable "Sick Mode" toggle
        
Evening - No time tracked today (0/120 minutes)

23:59 - Daily reset approaching
00:00 - Midnight Reset Automation runs:
        ✓ Detects Sick Mode is ON
        ✓ Preserves streak at 14 days
        ✓ Notification: "🏥 Krankheitstag - Streak bleibt bei 14 Tagen"
        ✓ Sick Mode automatically turns OFF
        ✓ Ready for fresh start tomorrow
```

**Result:** Streak preserved, fair accounting for legitimate downtime.

---

### Example 3: Retroactive Time Tracking

**Scenario:** You forgot to start the timer for a 2-hour morning work session.

**Workflow:**
```
14:00 - Realize you forgot to track morning work (09:00-11:00)
      - Go to Scripts → "flow_add_time"
      - Enter: 120 minutes
      - Click "Run"
      
      ✓ Notification: "➕ Zeit hinzugefügt - 120 Minuten"
      ✓ flow_time_tracked_today now shows 120 minutes
      ✓ Progress updated to 100%
      ✓ Goal reached notification may trigger
```

**Use Cases:**
- Forgot to start timer
- Worked offline/away from Home Assistant
- Retroactive tracking for yesterday (before midnight)
- Manual corrections for timer mistakes

---

### Example 4: Adaptive Goal Setting

**Scenario:** Fine-tuning your optimal daily goal over time.

**Week 1: Starting Conservative**
```
Monday   - Set goal: 60 min → Achieved 70 min ✓
Tuesday  - Goal: 60 min → Achieved 80 min ✓
Wednesday- Goal: 60 min → Achieved 90 min ✓
Thursday - Too easy! → Increase goal to 90 min
```

**Adjusting via Dashboard:**
```
1. Click "Ziel +5 Min" button 6 times
2. Goal increases: 60 → 90 minutes
3. New challenge begins Friday
```

**Week 2: Finding Balance**
```
Monday   - Goal: 90 min → Achieved 95 min ✓
Tuesday  - Goal: 90 min → Achieved 55 min ✗ (Streak lost)
Wednesday- Too aggressive! → Decrease goal to 75 min
```

**Result:** Personalized goal that's challenging but achievable.

### Example 5: Category-Based Work Analysis

**Scenario:** Understanding how you split time across work types.

**Day's Activity:**
```
09:00-10:30 │ Coding     │ 90 min │ Timer ON
10:30-11:30 │ Design     │ 60 min │ Timer ON
11:30-12:00 │ Break      │ —      │ Timer OFF
12:00-13:00 │ Engineering│ 60 min │ Timer ON
```

**Tracking Method:**
```
1. Start timer, select "Coding" → Work 90 min → Stop
2. Start timer, select "Design" → Work 60 min → Stop
3. Start timer, select "Engineering" → Work 60 min → Stop
```

**Results:**
- Total: 210 minutes tracked
- History graph shows three distinct work sessions
- sensor.flow_active_work captured each category change
- History data logs final totals

**Future Analysis:**
- View history graph to see time distribution
- Identify which work types consume most time
- Plan future days based on category patterns

### Example 6: Streak Recovery Strategy

**Scenario:** Lost a 30-day streak, need motivation to rebuild.

**Psychological Approach:**
```
Day 1 After Loss:
  - Set achievable goal (e.g., 60 minutes instead of 120)
  - Focus on rebuilding consistency, not duration
  - Celebrate small wins
  
Week 1: 7-day streak achieved
  - Gradually increase goal by 5-10 minutes
  
Week 2: 14-day streak achieved
  - Return to normal goal
  - Confidence restored
```

**Technical Setup:**
```
1. Use flow_decrease_goal to set realistic starting goal
2. Track progress without pressure
3. Use flow_increase_goal weekly as confidence builds
4. Enable sick_mode proactively for known busy days
```

---

### Example 7: Integration with Other Automations

**Scenario:** Automatically stop timer when leaving home.

**Create Custom Automation:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Flow - Auto Stop on Leave"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: person.your_name
        to: "not_home"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.flow_timer_active
        state: "on"
    action:
      - service: input_boolean.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: input_boolean.flow_timer_active
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "Flow Timer Auto-Stopped"
          message: "Timer automatically stopped as you left home"
```

**Other Integration Ideas:**
- Start timer automatically when opening IDE (via IDE plugin + webhook)
- Pause timer during lunch hours
- Sync categories with calendar events
- Send daily summary to Telegram/Slack
- Create weekly reports in Google Sheets

---

### Example 8: History Data Analysis

**Scenario:** Understanding your productivity patterns over time.

**Access History Data:**
```
1. Go to Developer Tools → States
2. Find: input_text.flow_history_data
3. Copy the JSON data
```

**Example Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "2024-01-15": {"percent": 105.5, "minutes": 127, "sick": false},
  "2024-01-16": {"percent": 98.2, "minutes": 118, "sick": false},
  "2024-01-17": {"percent": 0.0, "minutes": 0, "sick": true},
  "2024-01-18": {"percent": 112.0, "minutes": 134, "sick": false}
}
```

**Manual Analysis:**
- Copy to spreadsheet
- Calculate average daily minutes
- Identify patterns (productive weekdays vs weekends)
- Count sick days used
- Track goal achievement rate

**Future Enhancement Ideas:**
- Create template sensor for weekly averages
- Build custom graph card for history visualization
- Export to CSV for deeper analysis
- Create achievement badges for milestones

---

### Example 9: Family/Team Shared Setup

**Scenario:** Multiple people using Flow in the same Home Assistant instance.

**Setup for Person 1:**
```yaml
# In flow.yaml or packages, duplicate all entities:
input_number:
  flow_daily_goal_person1:
    name: "Person 1 - Tägliches Ziel"
    # ... same config as flow_daily_goal
  
  flow_daily_goal_person2:
    name: "Person 2 - Tägliches Ziel"
    # ... same config
```

**Separate Dashboards:**
- Create "Flow - Person 1" dashboard
- Create "Flow - Person 2" dashboard
- Each dashboard uses respective entities
- Enables friendly competition and mutual motivation

**Comparison View:**
```yaml
type: horizontal-stack
cards:
  - type: tile
    entity: sensor.flow_goal_progress_person1
    name: "Person 1 Progress"
  - type: tile
    entity: sensor.flow_goal_progress_person2
    name: "Person 2 Progress"
```

---

### Example 10: Emergency Reset Workflow

**Scenario:** Timer was accidentally left running overnight.

**Problem:**
```
Yesterday 18:00 - Started timer for "Coding"
                - Forgot to stop timer
Today 09:00     - Discover timer still running
                - 15 hours tracked (900 minutes!) ❌
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Stop the timer immediately
   → 900 minutes added to today's total (incorrect)

2. Run "flow_reset_day" script
   → Resets flow_time_tracked_today to 0
   → Clears all categories
   → Stops timer if still running

3. Manually track actual work:
   → Use flow_add_time script
   → Add correct amount (e.g., 120 minutes for yesterday)

4. Verify:
   → Check flow_time_tracked_today shows correct value
   → Streak remains intact (yesterday's data already logged)
```

**Prevention Tips:**
- Set phone reminder to check timer before bed
- Create automation to warn if timer runs > 4 hours
- Regular habit of reviewing dashboard evening

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Entities Not Appearing After Restart

**Solution:**
1. Check that `flow.yaml` is in the correct location
2. Verify `configuration.yaml` has the packages section
3. Check for YAML syntax errors:
   - Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Restart**
   - Click **Check Configuration** before restarting
4. Review Home Assistant logs:
   - Go to **Settings** → **System** → **Logs**

### Timer Not Tracking Time

**Solution:**
1. Verify the timer started:
   - Check `input_datetime.flow_timer_start` has a recent timestamp
2. Check automation is enabled:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Automations & Scenes**
   - Ensure "Flow - Timer Toggle Handler" is enabled
3. Review automation logs:
   - Click on the automation → **Traces** tab

### Automations Not Triggering

**Solution:**
1. Check automations are enabled (not accidentally disabled)
2. Verify entity IDs match (all should use `flow_` prefix)
3. Check automation mode (should be `single`)
4. Review traces for errors

### Daily Reset Not Working

**Solution:**
1. Verify "Flow - Daily Reset" automation is enabled
2. Check the trigger time is correct
3. Ensure Home Assistant Docker container timezone is set correctly:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it homeassistant date
   ```
4. If timezone is wrong, update your Docker compose file:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - TZ=Europe/Berlin  # Your timezone
   ```

### Streak Not Incrementing

**Solution:**
1. Goal must be reached (100% or more) before midnight
2. Verify `sensor.flow_goal_progress` shows >= 100
3. Check `input_number.flow_time_tracked_today` >= `input_number.flow_daily_goal`
4. Review "Flow - Daily Reset" automation traces

### Configuration Changes Not Taking Effect

**Solution:**
1. After editing YAML files, always restart Home Assistant
2. Check Configuration before restarting
3. Wait for full restart (watch the logs)
4. Clear browser cache if dashboard looks wrong
